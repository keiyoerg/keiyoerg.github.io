				<p>On December 17<sup>th</sup>, 1903 my ancestors successfully flew the first 
				sustained, controlled, powered heavier-than-air flight in a manned aircraft. 
				100 years later as the United States was celebrating the centennial of their 
				achievement, I had the honor of traveling the country and seeing the significance 
				of the industry they had started. This gave me the opportunity to meet aerospace 
				pioneers like Chuck Yeager and Neil Armstrong at a very young age, and inspired me 
				to work on continuing their legacy by becoming an engineer myself.</p>

				<h2 class="featurette-heading">Minnesota's First Brewery</h2>
				<p class="lead">Anthony Yoerg: Keith's Great-Great-Great Grandfather</p>
				<p>Anthony Yoerg was born in Bavaria on October 5<sup>th</sup>, 1816 
				and immigrated to the United States when he was 19 years old. After 
				moving around the country for a few years he ultimately settled in 
				Minnesota. It was there in 1848 that he opened the first brewery in 
				the state, Yoerg's Brewery.</p>
				<p>The brewery remained in business during prohibition in the 1900s by 
				pivoting to a dairy & soda soda operation. After prohibition was repealed 
				the company attempted to continue selling beer, however consolidation of 
				beer producers across the country made it extremely difficult to stay 
				profitable and the company closed for business in 1952.</p>
				<p>This history has inspired me to brew my own beer at home, and I plan 
				to improve my skill and create beers similar to the ones that my ancestor 
				sold so skillfully.</p>

				<p class="lead">William Yoerg & Ken Yoerg: Keith's Grandfather & Father</p>
				<p>My grandfather Bill was the first person in his family to receive a degree. 
				He studied civil engineering at South Dakota State University, and following 
				graduation he took a job working for the Minnesota Department of Transportation 
				in 1959. He worked there until his early death in September 1990. His work 
				influenced many policies within the Mn/DOT and in honor of his efforts, September 
				20<sup>th</sup> was named "Bill Yoerg Quality Recognition Day"</p>
				<p>My father Ken also decided to become an engineer, and earned a bachelor's 
				degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1983. Soon 
				after he began working for <a href="http://www.cargill.com/" target="_blank"
				data-toggle="tooltip" title"cargill.com">Cargill</a>, a global company that 
				provides agricultural products and services. He continues to work at Cargill 
				as he has for more than 25 years.</p>
