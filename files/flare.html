			(TAM) at the Compton airport. I loved TAM's mission to support the education of inner city kids, 
			but was disappointed to learn that a STEM museum only 15 minutes from SpaceX did not have any 
			rocketry programs. Seeing an opportunity to help the community, I established the Future Leaders 
			of Advanced Rocket Engineering (FLARE) Program at TAM. The goal of FLARE is to use the design, 
			construction, and flight of rockets to teach students the skills necessary to pursue a STEM degree 
			and career.</p>
			
			<p>At least once a week I visit TAM to teach classes. Program partners have included 
			the University of Southern Californa, the <a href="http://www.rrs.org/"

			different learning levels, I have developed curricula for multiple age groups:

				<p>Rocketry classes for kids grades K-6 are focused on fun. 
				Every class includes time playing <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/" 
				target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="kerbalspaceprogram.com"> Kerbal Space Program</a>, 
				a rocket design, building, and flying simulator. Knowledge of real-life rocket properties like 
				center of mass and center of pressure are crucial to creating a successful rocket in the game.</p>
				<p>Instruction time focuses on how knowledge of STEM ideas such as the scientific method and 
				Newton's Laws can improve rocket designs in the Kerbal video game. Alka-seltzer rockets and other 
				demonstrations are used to keep students engaged and discuss scientific principles.
				The capstone of each K-6 program is building and flying Estes model rockets, which the kids 
				get to keep (assuming it survives the maiden voyage)!</p>

				<p class="lead">Tripoli Rocketry Association Junior Membership</p>
				<p>Middle school aged rocket classes take things up a notch, both in the size
				of the rocket and the motors that go in them! Time is split between the classroom
				and the rocket lab, with a focus on safety and acting with intentionality.
				Class begins with discussion of any rocket or space news, followed by watching
				videos of rocket construction and discussing the techniques displayed. After a 
				safety briefing, class is moved to the lab area.</p>
				<p>Time in the lab is focused on safety, tool identification and use, and 
				construction of a high power solid rocket. Tools include epoxy, sandpaper, 
				power drills, and rotory tools. Students of the proper age with 
				parent or guardian approval are enrolled in the 
				<a href="http://www.tripoli.org/TMP" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="tripoli.org">
				Tripoli Mentoring Program</a>. Upon successful completion of an exam and
				construction of a high power rocket, students can earn their Junior Level 1
				certification, allowing them to access restricted launchpad areas.</p>

				<h2 class="featurette-heading">High School Curriculum</h2>
				<p class="lead">Rocket Design and Advanced Topics</p>
				<p>The high school coursework is a continuation of the previous levels. New 
				students are encouraged to start by building an Estes model rocket and 
				then enrolling in the Tripoli Mentoring Program. Like the middle school 
				course, time is split between the classroom and the lab. Classroom time 
				focuses on software that can aid in rocket design and construction. 
				Courses include SolidWorks 3D modeling, intro to Arduinos and Raspberry Pi 
				programming, and flight simulations in OpenRocket.</p>
				<p>Lab time focuses on increased experience safely using more complicated 
				tools such as the drill press and 3D printers. Students are encouraged to 
				pursue interests in building and making whatever they like, and those who 
				are interested design and build their own rockets from scratch. Properly 
				constructed rockets can be flown in the desert on a high power motor.</p>

				<p>Once age 18, students are encouraged to build and fly a high power rocket
				to earn a Level 1 certification through the Tripoli Rocketry Association 
				or National Association of Rocketry. Successful students can move on to 
				earn a Level 2 & 3 certification to continue launching bigger rockets and 
				motors. Interested students can join groups like the Reaction Research 
				Society to explore liquid rocketry.</p>
				<p>Those who have interests outside of rocketry are encouraged to explore 
				those as well! In the past students have 3D Printed a chess board, programmed 
				a text video game, and built small robots to name just a few projects.</p>
