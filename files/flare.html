			<p>In 2016 I was introduced to a local non-profit organization called <a href="http://www.tamuseum.org/"
			target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="www.tamuseum.org">Tomorrow's Aeronautical Museum</a> 
			(TAM) at the Compton airport. I loved TAM's mission to support the education of inner city kids, 
			but was disappointed to learn that a STEM museum only 15 minutes from SpaceX did not have any 
			rocketry programs. Seeing an opportunity to help the community, I established the Future Leaders 
			of Advanced Rocket Engineering (FLARE) Program at TAM. The goal of FLARE is to use the design, 
			construction, and flight of rockets to teach students the skills necessary to pursue a STEM degree 
			and career.</p>
			
			<p>At least twice a week I visit TAM to teach classes. To cater to different learning levels, I have 
			developed curricula for multiple age groups:

				<p>Rocketry classes for kids grades K-6 are focused on fun. 
				Every class includes time playing <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/" 
				target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="kerbalspaceprogram.com"> Kerbal Space Program</a>, 
				a rocket design, building, and flying simulator. Knowledge of real-life rocket properties like 
				center of mass and center of pressure are crucial to creating a successful rocket in the game.</p>
				<p>Instruction time focuses on how knowledge of STEM ideas such as the scientific method and 
				Newton's Laws can improve rocket designs in the Kerbal video game. Alka-seltzer rockets and other 
				demonstrations are used to keep students engaged and discuss scientific principles.</p>
				<p>The capstone of each K-6 program is building and flying Estes model rockets, which the kids 
				get to keep (assuming it survives the maiden voyage)!</p>

				<p>I established the FLARE (<i>Future Leaders of Advanced Rocket Engineering</i>) program
				at the Compton airport, which teaches STEM skills to multiple age groups of at risk youth.
				I visit the airport twice a week for about 3 hours to teach the kids and develop curricula.
				The classes are guided by what the students show the most interest in, however in general
				classes consist of the following:
				at least once a week to teach kids ages 8 - 16 about the basics 
				of rocketry and space travel. Topics range from Newton's Laws to the makeup of our Solar System 
				and any other technical topic the students have questions about.</p>
				<p>The lectures and discussions are balanced out with hands-on demonstrations of the principals covered.
				These demos include alka-seltzer "rockets", building and flying Estes model rockets, and use of the
				<a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="kerbalspaceprogram.com">
				Kerbal Space Program</a> video game to inspire the kids and make the topics more accessable.</p>

					<li>Showcase my achievements and interests to friends and potential employers.</li>
					<li>Build my skills as a web developer.</li>

				<p>Before this project I had very minimal experience with HTML, and absolutely no familiarity

				new skills. I'm pleased with this end result and excited to update the capabilities as I continue
				to learn more web development.</p>
